## :scroll: Project Description

This project aims to use the Stripe API for membership transactions when users want to upgrade from their current plans to higher plans while maintaining the interface's aesthetics.
<br><br>
### Here are some of the things that I learned and implemented throughout the creation of this project

:wrench: `Make use of the Stripe API` to handle the transaction

:bookmark_tabs: `Listen to events and extract the necessary information` to store or retrieve in the database.

:hook: `Learn about the webhook endpoint to read and handle the event` while providing the correct response.

:stars: Begin by `scratching the interface in Figma` to save time during the coding process.

## :clipboard: How to Use

### Create your Stripe account
1. Go to the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-my) website and register if you don't have one.
2. On the dashboard page, turn on the `Test mode` to safely make transactions in the testing environment.
> [!NOTE]
> By enabling the `Test mode`, you're using test data and real money won't be charged.
3. Click on the `Developers` section and find the `API keys`.
4. Copy the `Secret key` and paste it into the `php/secrets.php` file:
```php
<?php
$stripeSecretKey = 'PASTE YOUR SECRET KEY IN THIS STRING';
?>
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure not to reveal your `Secret key` to the public, as it is only accessible to your Stripe account.
